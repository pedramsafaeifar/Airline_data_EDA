# Airline_data_EDA
 In this project, a thorough understanding of how airline prices work is needed to effectively answer business requirements. The main objective is to have the best deals found for users and to help them understand how and why airline prices change based on different factors.

 The code and outputs are available in 'Airline_Analysis_EDA.ipynb'.

The data include:

'miles': miles travelled through the flight
'passengers': number of passengers on the flight
'delay': take-off delay in minutes
'inflight_meal': is there a meal included in the flight?
'inflight_entertainment': are there free entertainment systems for each seat?
'inflight_wifi': is there complimentary wifi on the flight?
'day_of_week': day of the week of the flight
'weekend': did this flight take place on a weekend
'coach_price': the average price paid for a coach ticket
'firstclass_price': the average price paid for first-class seats
'hours': how many hours the flight took
'redeye': was this flight a redeye (overnight)?


Business questions to be answered:
1. What do coach ticket prices look like? What are the high and low values? What would be considered the average?
2. The coach ticket prices for flights that are 8 hours long are now being visualized. What are the high, low, and average prices for these 8-hour-long flights?
3. How is the distribution of flight delay times observed? The aim is to gain a better understanding of the frequency of significant delays to appropriately arrange connecting flights.¶
What types of delays are most common?
4. A visualization is to be created that shows the relationship between the coach and first-class prices. The relationship between these two prices is to be analyzed.
5. What is the relationship between coach prices and inflight features— inflight meal, inflight entertainment, and inflight WiFi? Which features are associated with the highest increase in price?
6. How does the number of passengers change in relation to the length of flights?
7. Visualize the relationship between coach and first-class prices on weekends compared to weekdays.
8. How do coach prices differ for redeyes and non-redeyes on each day of the week?
